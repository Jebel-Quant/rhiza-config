# rhiza-config

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](LICENSE)

A [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) plugin marketplace providing the
**`rhiza`** plugin — slash commands for working in rhiza-managed repos (template
sync, code-quality scoring, README/doc upkeep, and repo stats).

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add Jebel-Quant/rhiza-config
/plugin install rhiza@rhiza-config
```

The commands then appear namespaced under the plugin: `/rhiza:boost`,
`/rhiza:quality`, `/rhiza:revisit`, `/rhiza:stats`. Type `/rhiza` to have Claude
Code autocomplete them.

## Commands

- **`/rhiza:boost`** — bump the current repo to the latest (or a given) rhiza
  release, sync the template, resolve conflicts upstream, run the quality gates,
  and open a PR with a quality scorecard.
- **`/rhiza:quality`** — run the rhiza code-quality gate (lint, types, docs,
  deps, security, tests, complexity, architecture) and score the repo.
- **`/rhiza:revisit`** — create or revisit the current repo's `README.md` (with
  the full standard badge set), `CLAUDE.md`, and `mkdocs.yml`, preserving
  hand-written prose while refreshing badges and correcting drift.
- **`/rhiza:stats`** — read-only statistics dashboard for the current repo:
  lines of code/tests and their ratio, stars, open issues, PRs, branches,
  commits, releases, coverage, complexity, dependencies, and rhiza template
  status.

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | Marketplace manifest listing the `rhiza` plugin. |
| `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | The `rhiza` plugin manifest. |
| `commands/` | The plugin's slash commands (one `.md` per command). |

## Contributing

Edit the command `.md` files under `commands/`, then commit and push:

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "..." && git push
```

Installed users pick up changes the next time the marketplace refreshes.
