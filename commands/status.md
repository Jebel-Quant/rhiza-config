description: Show the current rhiza sync status for the repo — the template repository, ref, synced commit SHA, sync timestamp, strategy, and the templates/paths that were materialized. Runs the bundled scripts/status.py (a stdlib-only read of .rhiza/template.lock), so it works without the rhiza CLI installed. Read-only; no scoring, no fixes, no issues.

You are running `/status` in the **current working directory's repo**.

**This command is a thin wrapper around the bundled `scripts/status.py`.** All the
lock-reading and formatting lives in that script — a deterministic, stdlib-only
Python program that reads `.rhiza/template.lock` directly (no `rhiza` CLI, no
PyYAML required). Do **not** re-implement the parsing or gather the fields
yourself; run the script and relay its output. Keeping the logic in one place is
the point: the script is the single source of truth.

This is purely descriptive — it **reports the recorded sync state; it does not
score, fix, or file anything**.

Argument (optional): `$ARGUMENTS` — a path to the repo root to inspect; default
is the current directory.

## 1. Run the script
Invoke it with the plugin-root path (it ships inside this plugin, so
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolves at runtime — **keep the quotes**):

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/status.py" $ARGUMENTS
```

- Pass `$ARGUMENTS` through as the optional target path. If it's empty, just omit it.
- Add `--json` only when the user wants machine-readable output; the default is
  the human-readable summary.
- Add `--files` (alias `--tree`) when the user wants the managed files listed as
  a directory tree beneath the summary — this is the view the retired
  `/rhiza:tree` command used to give. `--json` already includes the `files`
  array, so `--files` only affects the human-readable output.

## 2. If the script can't run
- If `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is empty (e.g. you're in a source checkout of this repo,
  not an installed plugin), fall back to the repo-relative path: `python3 scripts/status.py $ARGUMENTS`.
- If `python3` is missing, or the script is genuinely not found at either path, report
  that plainly and stop — don't hand-roll the status as a substitute.

## 3. Relay the results
- Show the script's output as-is — it's already formatted.
- If it printed `No template.lock found`, the repo hasn't been synced yet: tell the
  user to run `rhiza sync` first. This is not an error.
- You may add **one short line** noting how fresh the sync looks (ref + synced-at),
  but **no scores and no recommendations**. For an assessment, point them at `/quality`;
  for a fuller dashboard, `/stats`.
